            You're a ghost scout looking to find and confirm the haunted spirit.Your job is simple, find the right ghost, to inform the ghost hunting team so they can bring the right equipment for the job. You are assigned to a small street house on the end of a block. We also believe the Ghost's name to be <b><u>Mary Brown</u></b>. That's all we know about her. However, you have many items at your disposal, and a notepad on the top-left of the page incase you get lost. Find and gather as much evidence as you can and report back to HQ once you finish. Good luck!
        </p>
            <p class="bottomText"> Rules: This is a non-linear mystery/horror game that allows you to find and discover the ghost from exploration and finding the right evidence. For help, there will be 2 skyboxes showing the types of evidence to use, and of the types of ghosts available. There will also be a map showing where you are currently located. Have fun!</p>
